A powerful, cross-platform 2D RPG creation platform for Windows and Android, designed to bring your stories to life with minimal coding. Inspired by classics like RPG Maker, Aether Engine provides a modern, integrated environment for indie developers and hobbyists.

## About The Project

Aether Engine is a comprehensive suite of tools that enables developers to create, collaborate on, and export 2D role-playing games. It features a visual, drag-and-drop interface for building worlds and defining complex game logic, supported by a robust backend and a rich asset library. Our goal is to streamline the development process, making game creation more accessible and collaborative.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the .NET MAUI workload installed
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (Express, Developer, or full edition)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aether-engine.git
    cd aether-engine
    ```

2.  **Configure Backend Secrets:**

    - Navigate to the backend API project directory.
    - Create a file named `appsettings.Development.json`.
    - Add your database connection string and GitHub OAuth credentials:
      ```json
      {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
          "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=AetherEngineDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
        },
        "GitHub": {
          "ClientId": "your_github_client_id",
          "ClientSecret": "your_github_client_secret"
        }
      }
      ```

3.  **Apply Database Migrations:**

    - Navigate to the backend API project directory in your terminal.
    - Run the Entity Framework migration command to create the database schema:
      ```sh
      dotnet ef database update
      ```

4.  **Run the Backend API:**

    - Open a terminal in the backend API project directory and run:
      ```sh
      dotnet run
      ```
    - The API will be available at `https://localhost:7xxx` and `http://localhost:5xxx`.

5.  **Run the MAUI Client:**
